# Pipeline Fixed - Ready for Testing

## What Was Changed

### Issue
- Step 2 was trying to merge isoform and gene data by cell barcode
- Cell barcodes don't match perfectly between the two assays at the unfiltered stage
- This caused correlation calculation errors: "no complete element pairs"

### Solution
**Kept isoform and gene QC completely separate:**
- No merging of cell barcodes
- No per-cell isoforms/gene ratio calculation
- Separate QC metrics for each assay
- Side-by-side comparison plots only

## Updated Output

### Step 2: Detailed Quality Control

**Now generates 10 plots (was 12):**

| Plot # | Filename | Description | Assay |
|--------|----------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | `07_total_isoform_counts_histogram` | Total isoform counts per cell | Isoform |
| 2 | `08_total_gene_counts_histogram` | Total gene counts per cell | Gene |
| 3 | `09_isoforms_detected_histogram` | Isoforms detected per cell | Isoform |
| 4 | `10_genes_detected_histogram` | Genes detected per cell | Gene |
| 5 | `11_isoform_counts_vs_isoforms_scatter` | Counts vs features (isoform) | Isoform |
| 6 | `12_gene_counts_vs_genes_scatter` | Counts vs features (gene) | Gene |
| 7 | `13_isoform_counts_by_timepoint_violin` | Counts by timepoint (isoform) | Isoform |
| 8 | `14_gene_counts_by_timepoint_violin` | Counts by timepoint (gene) | Gene |
| 9 | `15_mt_isoform_percent_violin` | MT% by timepoint (isoform) | Isoform |
| 10 | `16_mt_gene_percent_violin` | MT% by timepoint (gene) | Gene |

**Layout:** 2 columns × 5 rows (alternating isoform/gene)

### Removed Plots
- ~~`13_isoforms_per_gene_histogram`~~ (required merged data)
- ~~`18_isoforms_per_gene_ratio_violin`~~ (required merged data)

### Data Files
**Kept:**
- `detailed_qc_isoform.csv/rds` - Isoform assay QC
- `detailed_qc_gene.csv/rds` - Gene assay QC

**Removed:**
- ~~`detailed_qc_combined.csv/rds`~~ (no merging at unfiltered stage)

## Updated Debug Output

**New log messages:**
```
[INFO] Detailed quality control completed
[INFO] Isoform assay - Total cells: XXXX, Median isoforms/cell: XXX, Median counts/cell: XXXXX
[INFO] Gene assay - Total cells: XXXX, Median genes/cell: XXX, Median counts/cell: XXXXX
```

**Removed:**
- ~~"Average isoforms per gene per cell"~~ (not applicable without merging)

## When Cell Matching Will Happen

**Future filtering step will:**
1. Apply QC thresholds to each assay independently
2. Match cell barcodes between filtered isoform and gene data
3. Create combined Seurat object with both `RNA` and `iso` assays
4. Only cells passing QC in BOTH assays will be retained
5. Then can calculate per-cell isoforms/gene ratios

## Ready to Test

The pipeline should now run successfully:
```bash
cd /data/gpfs/projects/punim2251/Neurodevelopmental_Models_analysis/previous_project_analysis_scripts
R
source("analysis_pipeline/main.R")
```

Expected output:
- ✅ Step 1 completes (6 plots)
- ✅ Step 2 completes (10 plots)
- ✅ No merge errors
- ✅ Clean separation between isoform and gene assays
